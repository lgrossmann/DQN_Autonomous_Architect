# DQN_Autonomous_Architect
I currently aim to program a Reinforcement learning application for Architecture  that combines a client happiness prediction artificial neural network I did last year with a Physical Environment. I.e., I want to use RL to generate a basic shape output imagery, for a building that then represents the clients best interests, budget and space efficiency, in a physics simulation, abstractly, with different types of "blocks" that the agents assemble. This stage is training and testing the agents, the system, to gain the maximal possible rewards of the situation, learning from previous episodes, from previous data, to achieve the best possible shape of the design.  I then hope to use a GAN that identifies the shape and based on an architectural imagery database, generates, selective of images tagged with features of the client's preferences, generates a new image, abstract, basic design upon which the architect can build further ideas, become inspired, or and continue with the remaining steps of the design process. I also hope to be able to transfer this concept into a three dimensional environment.
